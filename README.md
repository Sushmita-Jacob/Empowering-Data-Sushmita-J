# Empowering Data Project Starter Code

I created this project for the Girls Who Code Pathways Program 2025. Empowering Data: Women's Wellness is the second project I made for the Data Science + AI Track. Below are the requirements and information provided by Girls Who Code. This project was also submitted to Hack Club's Athena Award, a technical certificate for female and non-binary coders.
